Smart Campus Health and Safety Notification Application 
Project Description 
This project aims to develop a system that allows users to quickly report incidents such 
as health, safety, environmental, lost-and-found, and technical malfunctions occurring on 
campus via a mobile application, view them on a map, track their status, and update them by 
administrators. Users report incidents through a simple interface, while the Admin role manages 
these notifications, changes their status, and issues emergency announcements when necessary. 
The application provides a centralized digital notification platform that aims to improve security 
and communication on campus.

Use of Artificial Intelligence

functions, classes, components, etc. cannot be taken from AI. 
• Adding code received from AI to a project without understanding it is prohibited. Students 
must be able to explain all the code they add during the presentation. 
• AI may only be used for consulting purposes. Non-code-generating support such as error 
descriptions, concept learning, and feedback are permitted. 
• The Git history must be organized, and the development process must be visible. Large 
blocks of code uploaded at once are considered suspicious. If necessary, a small section can 
be rewritten during the presentation. 
• If an AI usage violation is detected, the relevant section will not be considered for 
evaluation. If necessary, the project may be completely invalidated.
